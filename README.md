Stock Price Forecasting using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using multiple machine learning algorithms trained on historical stock data.

Dataset
The dataset used contains historical closing prices for AAPL stock. It is stored in a CSV file and includes daily records such as date and closing price.

Models Used
The following models were implemented and evaluated:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

LightGBM Regressor

Evaluation
All models were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy. Among them, the LSTM model achieved the best performance, showing strong capabilities in forecasting sequential financial data.

Project Highlights
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Time-series modeling with deep learning (LSTM)

Comparative analysis of machine learning models

Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices
